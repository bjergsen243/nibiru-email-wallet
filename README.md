# Email Wallet on Nibiru

A smart contract wallet controlled using emails.


Email Wallet is an Nibiru contract wallet that can be controlled by sending emails. The contract validates the authenticity of emails by verifying the ZK Proof of DKIM signature of the email. This ensures email is generated by the user without leaking user's email address on-chain.

#### Things you can do:

- ✓ Send Nibi to email address and Nibiru addresses.
  - `Send 1 Nibi to friend@domain.com`
  - `Send 2.5 Nibi to nibi1tsgl9sr8ayy4s9fdf9mr2ck2tptpjy2shdj7ky`

- ✓ Send CW20 to email address and Nibi addresses.
  - `Send 1.5 RHV to friend@skiff.com`
  - `Send 21.14 RHV to nibi1tsgl9sr8ayy4s9fdf9mr2ck2tptpjy2shdj7ky`

- ✓ Use NFT extension to mint NFTs.
  - `NFT Send 1 of FHM to recipient@domain.com` (and more)

- ✓ Execute any calldata on a target contract
  - `Execute nibi15qsut0gpr53h4.....`

### In progress:

- ✓ Install extensions for additional functionalities. Extensions can be developed for any DeFi protocols.
  - `Install extension Nibi-Swap`
  - `Remove extension Nibi-Swap`

- ✓ Use Nibi-Swap extension to swap tokens.
  - `Swap 1 UNIBI to FHM`
  - `Swap 1 FHM to UNIBI`
 
- ✓ Use account abstraction to be more privacy

- ✓ Set email wallet to a new owner. New owner (EOA) can control the wallet by executing any calldata on a target contract.
  - `Exit Email Wallet. Set owner to nibi1tsgl9sr8ayy4s9fdf9mr2ck2tptpjy2shdj7ky...`

#### Features:
- ✓ No need to install any browser extension or mobile app.
- ✓ No need to remember any seed phrase or private key.
- ✓ Operate the wallet by sending human readable emails.
- ✓ Hide link from an email address to a wallet address.
- ✓ Developers can build extensions to add new functionalities.

#### Security Considerations:
1. Safety guarantee: if your email domain server does not forge your emails, no one can send assets in your wallet.
2. Liveness guarantee: if your email domain server does not block your emails and you stores an invitation email that you have received before, you can execute a new transaction on-chain.
3. Privacy protection against DoS scanning attacks: no adversary can learn an address or existence of the wallet for your email address for free.
- Sender might be able learn the recipient's wallet address by scanning blockchain for the specific amount.
